# Direction Selection

Put towards the bottom of yoru SRPG plugins

Also requires a graphic to show the direction selected

![Example](https://github.com/boomyville/RMMZ/blob/main/Boomy%20SRPG%20Direction%20Selection/example.gif?raw=true)

Some things to note:

- Does not work well with touch input (fingers) since a tap is registered as "OK" so users can't really drag their fingers around the screen to select a direction
- Does not work with map battle skills
