# Terrain modifier

This script allows the developer to use the event notetag <terrainTag:X> to modify the terrainid of a tile
This is useful for example:

Create a 'buff' square that is randomly spawned during the battle
Create a bridge that changes the terrainid from impassable to passable
Create a map where the tide rises and causes tiles to reduce movement
